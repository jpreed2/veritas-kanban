# Getting Started with Veritas Kanban

> **Credit:** This guide exists because **Neal (@nealmummau)** asked how to get Veritas Kanban working with AI agents in under five minutes. Thank you for pushing us to document the real workflow.

Whether you are standing up the board for yourself or for a fleet of agents, this guide walks you from zero ➝ working board ➝ agents picking up work. Each section is short, copy/paste friendly, and mirrors how we run Veritas Kanban internally.

## Prerequisites (30 seconds)

| What              | Command            | Notes                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js           | `node -v`          | Requires **22+**. Install via Volta/nvm if older.  |
| pnpm              | `pnpm -v`          | Requires **9+**. `npm install -g pnpm` if missing. |
| Git               | `git --version`    | Any current version works.                         |
| (Optional) Docker | `docker --version` | Needed only if you prefer containers.              |

That’s it. No database, no extra services.

## Installation & Setup Wizard (manual today, guided tomorrow)

A scripted setup wizard (`vk setup`) is on the roadmap. Until it ships, follow the manual wizard below (same phases you’ll see in the UI later):

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BradGroux/veritas-kanban.git
cd veritas-kanban
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure server

a. Copy the sample env

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

b. Edit the new file:

- `VERITAS_ADMIN_KEY` → 32+ chars (use `node -e "console.log(crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`)
- `VERITAS_AUTH_ENABLED=true` (default)
- `VERITAS_AUTH_LOCALHOST_BYPASS=true` to avoid auth friction locally
- Optional: set `HOST=127.0.0.1` (avoids proxy ambiguity)

### 3. Start the dev stack

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Web boots on **3000**, API on **3001**. First boot seeds demo tasks so you have something to look at.

### 4. Run the in-app setup

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) → follow the onboarding form:

- Create your admin password
- Save the recovery key (seriously; it’s the only way to regain access)
- Log in and confirm you can see the seeded board

> 🧙 **Setup Wizard roadmap:** v1.5 will ship an interactive `vk setup` CLI that steps through these same actions, validates ports, and optionally provisions starter API keys.

## Create Your First Task (UI path)

1. Click **New Task** on the board.
2. Fill title, description (Markdown), pick a type + priority.
3. Optional: assign a sprint/project.
4. Hit **Create** and watch it appear in **Todo**.
5. Drag it to **In Progress** to feel the flow.

> Need a clean slate? Remove the example tasks: `rm tasks/active/task_example_*.md`

---

## Create Your First Task (API/CLI path)

### REST call (curl)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: <YOUR_ADMIN_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Wire up MCP server",
    "description": "Create CLI + MCP parity",
    "type": "feature",
    "priority": "high"
  }'
```

### CLI (after `cd cli && npm link`)

```bash
vk create "Wire up MCP server" --type feature --priority high
vk list --status todo
```

CLI commands fully mirror the API and are the fastest way to script agent workflows.

## Connect an Agent + Agent Pickup Checklist

Agents interact through HTTP + WebSocket; nothing is hard-coded to a particular provider. Follow this checklist to verify they can pick up work:

1. **Create an agent API key** in `server/.env`:
   ```
   VERITAS_API_KEYS=my-agent:super-secret-key:agent,ops:another-key:admin
   ```
2. **Restart** `pnpm dev` so the key loads.
3. **Create an agent request** (UI → Start Agent) or drop a JSON file in `.veritas-kanban/agent-requests/`.
4. **Watch pending agents** in the UI or via CLI:
   ```bash
   vk agents:pending
   ```
5. **Agent workflow** (example prompt to OpenClaw):
   ```
   Hey Veritas, pick up task <ID>. Set status to in-progress, start the timer, do the work, then call `vk done <id> "summary"` when finished. Use cross-model review if you wrote code.
   ```
6. **Agent completion**
   - Verify `tasks/active/...` reflects status/time tracking
   - Check `.veritas-kanban/logs/agents.log` for run details
   - Confirm UI Agent Status indicator flips back to **Idle**

> **Automation tip:** Keep a `prompts/` folder (see below) so agents get consistent instructions for sprint planning, reviews, research, etc.

## Sanity Checks & Quick Fixes

These cover the “something feels off” moments before you deep-dive logs.

### 1. API health (up in <1s)

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/health | jq
```

Expect `{ "ok": true, "service": "veritas-kanban", ... }`. If the call hangs or returns HTML, something else is on the port.

### 2. UI health

- Browser hard refresh (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R`)
- If blank, open devtools → Console for errors.
- Verify WebSocket indicator (top right) shows **Connected**; if not, check proxies/CORS.

### 3. Agent pickup sanity

- `.veritas-kanban/agent-requests/` should have JSON per request. If files accumulate, agents are not acknowledging them.
- `vk agents:pending` returning nothing while UI shows pending usually means API key mismatch; regenerate and restart.

### 4. Common failure modes & instant fixes

| Symptom                     | Quick Fix                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ports collide / UI hung     | `pnpm dev:clean`                                              |
| Health endpoint returns 404 | Wrong project running on 3001 (restart)                       |
| Auth spamming rate limit    | Ensure request IP is `127.0.0.1` or increase limiter          |
| Agents “never pick up”      | Verify API key role `agent`, check firewall/Docker networking |

For deeper debugging see [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Shared Resources & Prompt Registry

BoardKit Orchestrator inspired us here: keep prompts, skills, and guidelines in one place so every repo/agent stays in sync.

**Until first-class registry lands in v1.5, do this manually:**

1. Create `shared/prompt-registry/` at the repo root (git-tracked).
2. Add Markdown files per workflow, e.g.:
   - `shared/prompt-registry/sprint-planning.md`
   - `shared/prompt-registry/code-review.md`
   - `shared/prompt-registry/research-report.md`
3. Reference them inside tasks (`See prompt: shared/prompt-registry/...`).
4. When spawning agents (OpenClaw `sessions_spawn`), paste the relevant prompt so the run is reproducible.

> **Future state:** US-1611 will move this into `.veritas-kanban/templates/prompts.json` with UI + API surfaces. Document your prompts now so migration is painless later.

## Documentation Freshness & Repo Rules

Stale docs = hallucinating AI. Keep these files current:

| File                           | Purpose                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AGENTS.md`                    | Personality, escalation rules, cross-model review requirement. |
| `SOUL.md`                      | “Who are we?” — tone/voice used by agents.                     |
| `CLAUDE.md` / `GPT.md`         | Model-specific guardrails or lessons learned.                  |
| `docs/BEST-PRACTICES.md` (new) | Patterns and anti-patterns all agents follow.                  |

**Cadence:**

- Update immediately after a mistake or new learning.
- Mirror to Brain/knowledge base if you use one (see `scripts/brain-write.sh`).
- During sprint closure, skim the “Lessons Learned” field on each task and propagate anything evergreen into AGENTS/CLAUDE.

---

## Multi-Repo / Multi-Agent Notes

Running multiple projects or repos with the same agent pool? Borrow BoardKit’s approach:

- Keep shared assets (skills, prompts, SOPs) under a top-level `shared/` folder.
- For each repo, mount/symlink only what you need (manual today; native support in US-1611).
- Use consistent naming for agent API keys so dashboards stay readable (`project-agent-name`).
- Record sub-agent usage with `vk agent sub-agent <count>` so the Agent Status sidebar matches reality.

---

## OpenClaw Browser Relay (Optional but Recommended)

For auth-required workflows (LinkedIn research, dashboards behind Okta, etc.) you’ll want OpenClaw’s Browser Relay:

1. Install the extension + helper from the [OpenClaw docs](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw).
2. Launch the relay; attach your tab.
3. Agents can now run headless instructions through your actual browser session while respecting your credentials.

This is invaluable for Champions-style research tasks or anything needing a real login flow.

---

## What’s Next?

1. Read the SOPs:
   - [Agent Task Workflow](SOP-agent-task-workflow.md)
   - [Sprint Planning with AI Agents](SOP-sprint-planning.md)
   - [Multi-Agent Orchestration](SOP-multi-agent-orchestration.md)
   - [Cross-Model Code Review](SOP-cross-model-code-review.md)
2. Align on [Best Practices](BEST-PRACTICES.md) & [Tips + Tricks](TIPS-AND-TRICKS.md).
3. Browse [Real-world Examples](EXAMPLES-agent-workflows.md) and steal the prompts.
4. Keep `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` handy for deeper diagnostics.

You now have a board, agents that can pick up work, and a safety net when things wobble. Go ship something.
